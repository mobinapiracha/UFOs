# UFOs

The website is deployed on github pages on the following link: https://mobinapiracha.github.io/UFOs/

### Overview 
In this project we will assume the role of Data Journalist who is interested in using dynamic webpages to create an article and present data on UFO sightings. We will use Javascript in combination with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a dynamic webpages which will display our article on UFOs along with some data presented in a table. Our table will include interactive features such as a filters tab for our table which allow users to refine their search. Therefore we will present our article, our table of data that supports our findings and easy to use filters in an visually appealing HTML page. Our end result will be a presentation of data that is visually appealing and interactive. 

### Results
* Created a dynamic webpage with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, posting our UFO article along with our data into the webpage and adding a filter criteria for Date, City, State, Country and Shape so users can filter for specific sightings. 
*  To search for a particular UFO sighting, please look at the image below

Here we have a our webpage with the data and the search filters. We have placeholders in our filters as an example of how to carry out a search. Now to filter our search we will simply go to any of our search bars, type our criteria and enter it. For example if I want to search for sightings in california in the shape of a light, we will simply type "ca" as our state and "light" as our shape and press enter, we see our search filtered to all reported sightings in california in form of a shape.
